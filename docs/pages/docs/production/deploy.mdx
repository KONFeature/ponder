# Deploy

- [Railway (recommended)](#railway-recommended)
- [Render](#render)
- [Other environments](#other-environments)

## Railway (recommended)

[Railway](https://railway.app) is currently the best place to deploy Ponder apps. Most Ponder apps cost ~$5 per month, and the deployment process is simple.

<Steps>

### Sign up or log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add your project's RPC URL (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and any other environment variables
3. Expose your service to the public internet. Open the **Settings** tab and click **Generate Domain** under **Networking**
4. Set a healthcheck path. In the **Settings** tab, enter `/health` for **Healthcheck Path** under **Deploy**

<Callout type="warning">
  _Monorepo users:_ You'll need to update your service's **Start Command**. This
  can be found under **Settings** → **Deploy** → **Start Command**. Make sure
  the command runs `ponder start` at the Ponder project root (e.g. `cd
  packages/ponder && pnpm start`).
</Callout>

### Create a PostgreSQL database service

From your project dashboard, click **New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.

### Add the `DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL` environment variable

1. Go back to your service. Open **Variables** tab and click on **New Variable**.
2. Click **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL` → **Add**.


After a moment, your Ponder service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Render

[Render](https://render.com) is also a great platform for deploying Ponder apps.

<Steps>

### Sign up or log in to Render

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Render dashboard:

1. Click **New** → **Web Service** → **Build and deploy from a Git repository** → **Next**, then select your repo from the list.
2. (For monorepos) Set the **Root Directory** to your Ponder project directory (e.g. `packages/ponder`).
3. Add **Environment Variables**. Be sure to include any RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`).
4. Click **Advanced** → **Health Check Path** and enter `/health`.
5. Click **Create Web Service**.

### Create a PostgreSQL database service

From your project dashboard, click **New** → **PostgreSQL**, enter a name for the database, and click **Create Database**.

### Add the `DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL` environment variable

1. Go to the database service **Info** tab. Under **Connections**, copy the **Internal Database URL** to your clipboard.
2. Go to the Ponder service **Environment** tab, and add a new environment variable named `DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL` using the value you copied.

After a moment, the Ponder service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Logs** tab to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Other environments

Ponder has not been thoroughly tested on cloud providers other than Railway and Render. However, Ponder apps should work in any environment that supports Node.js and can connect to a PostgreSQL database.
